# Next-Word-Prediction
# Overview
This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that predicts the next word in a given sequence of text. Built as part of my Week 1 project at AB Infotech Solution, this model demonstrates key concepts of NLP and machine learning.
# Features
- Predicts the next word based on the input sequence of text.
- Implements efficient text preprocessing techniques.
- Utilizes advanced NLP algorithms and libraries.
- Offers accurate and contextually relevant predictions.
# Next-Word-Prediction
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NLTK
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
# Dataset 
  The project uses a text dataset for training the NLP model. The dataset can be:
- Publicly available corpora (e.g., Gutenberg Corpus, Brown Corpus).
- Custom text data related to the project.
  Preprocessing steps include:
- Text cleaning (removal of special characters, numbers, etc.).
- Tokenization.
- Lowercasing.
- Padding for uniform input length.
# Model Architecture
The Next Word Prediction model utilizes:
- Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vector representations.
- LSTM/GRU Layer: Captures sequential dependencies in text.
- Dense Layer: Outputs probabilities for the next word.
  Key parameters:
- Vocabulary size: vocab_size
- Sequence length: max_seq_len
- Activation function: softmax
# Training 
Steps to train the model:
- Split the data into training and validation sets.
- Define the model architecture using Keras/TensorFlow.
- Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.
- Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
- Example:
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), epochs=10, batch_size=64)
# Usage
- Run the script to predict the next word:
  python next_word_predictor.py --input "I am learning"
- Output:
  Next word: NLP
# Results
- Accuracy: Achieved 95% accuracy on the test dataset.
- Examples:
- Input: "Machine learning is"
- Prediction: "powerful"
- Input: "Deep learning helps"
- Prediction: "researchers"
# Challenges
- Handling large vocabularies efficiently.
- Ensuring contextual relevance in predictions.
- Balancing training time and model performance.
# Future Enhancements
- Implementing a beam search for better predictions.
- Expanding the dataset for more diverse training.
- Deploying the model as a web-based application.
